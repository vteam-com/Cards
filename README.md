## Game Mechanics & Scoring Systems

### üéØ Active Evaluation (SkyJo)
- Cards are physically removed from players' hands during gameplay
- When a player forms sets of 3 cards with the same rank, those cards are discarded
- Player hands change composition throughout the game
- Scoring happens continuously as cards are eliminated

### üèåÔ∏è Passive Scoring (Golf-Style Games)
- Card layout remains unchanged during gameplay
- Scoring calculated based on final revealed card positions
- Matched cards (same rank) don't contribute to final score
- Scoring occurs after all cards are revealed

### Game Variants

#### French Cards (9 Card Golf)
- 3x3 grid (9 cards per player)
- Matches within rows and columns reduce score
- Matched set cards are not counted in final score

#### MiniPut
- 2x2 grid (4 cards per player)
- Matches within rows and columns reduce score
- Simplified version of Golf game

#### SkyJo
- 4x3 grid (12 cards per player)
- 3-of-a-kind sets are discarded during play
